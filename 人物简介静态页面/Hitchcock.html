		<div class="note">
			<p>The "Hitchcockian" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. </p>
			<p>The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film "is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.</p>

			<section class="entry">
				<p>Here&#8217;s a little curio which appeared in the <em>San Antonio Light</em> newspaper on 26th April 1945, nearly 20 years before Hitchcock made <em><a href="//the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/The Birds">The Birds</a></em> (1963). In an article titled &#8220;Peace Plans Pour Into Conference&#8221;, the newspaper apparently asked Hitchcock what might happen if there was another world war&#8230;</p>
				<blockquote><p>Hitchcock believes that birds will inherit the earth, if there is another war. He told us recently: &#8220;Crows, probably. You can see that they&#8217;re working that way already. They hold courts, have a fair language and a rudimentary banking system. I like their chances of taking over.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

						<h3>
							The Man Who Knew Too Much(1934)
						</h3>
						<img src="img/film1.jpg" alt="tmktm" />
						<p>The film is Hitchcock's first film using this title and was followed later with his own 1956 film using the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. The second film featured James Stewart and Doris Day and was made for Paramount Pictures. The two films are very different in tone. In the book-length interview Hitchcock/Truffaut (1967), in response to filmmaker François Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, "Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional</p>

							Rebecca(1940)
						</h3>
						<img src="img/film2.jpg" alt="rbc"/>
						<p>The film is a gothic tale shot in black-and-white. Maxim de Winter's first wife Rebecca, who died before the events of the film, is never seen. Her reputation and recollections of her, however, are a constant presence in the lives of Maxim, his new wife and the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers.</p>

						<p>Rebecca won two Academy Awards, Best Picture and Cinematography, out of a total 11 nominations. Olivier, Fontaine and Anderson also were Oscar-nominated for their respective roles as were Hitchcock and the screenwriters.</p>

						<h3>
							Notorious(1946)
						</h3>
						<img src="img/film3.jpg" alt="ntr" />
						<p>Notorious is considered by critics and scholars to mark a watershed for Hitchcock artistically, and to represent a heightened thematic maturity. His biographer, Donald Spoto, writes that "Notorious is in fact Alfred Hitchcock's first attempt—at the age of forty-six—to bring his talents to the creation of a serious love story, and its story of two men in love with Ingrid Bergman could only have been made at this stage of his life."</p>

						<h3>
							The Stranger on the Train(1951)
						</h3>
						<img src="img/film4.jpg" alt="tsott" />
						<p>The story concerns two strangers who meet on a train, a young tennis player and a charming psychopath. The psychopath suggests that because they each want to "get rid" of someone, they should "exchange" murders, and that way neither will be caught. The psychopath commits the first murder, then tries to force the tennis player to complete the bargain.</p>

						<h3>
							Dial M for Murder(1954)
						</h3>
						<img src="img/film5.jpg" alt="dmfm" />
						<p>Dial M for Murder is a 1954 American crime mystery film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and John Williams. Both the screenplay and the successful stage play on which it was based were written by English playwright Frederick Knott. The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television, before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October. Originally intended to be shown in dual-strip polarized 3-D, the film played in most theatres in ordinary 2-D due to the loss of interest in the 3-D process (the projection of which was difficult and error-prone) by the time of its release. The film earned an estimated $2.7 million at the North American box office in 1954.</p>
